# wc-stats extraction pipeline

Python extraction pipeline for FIFA World Cup 2026 Post Match Summary Reports (PMSR PDFs).

## Setup (two commands)

From the repo root, on Windows:

```
python -m venv pipeline/venv
pipeline\venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pip install -r pipeline/requirements.txt
```

Requires Python 3.13+ (developed and verified on 3.14.4). Dependencies are installed
with **pip** — this project does not use `uv` (AR-15).

`pipeline/venv/` is this pipeline's own environment. `spike/venv` is a frozen reference
from the exploration spike and must not be reused or modified.

## Verification mode (template-consistency gate)

Runs the standing template-consistency gate over a stratified venue × matchday sample of
a PMSR corpus:

```
pipeline\venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pipeline.validate.verify --input-dir <corpus-dir>
```

The input directory is a required argument — no corpus path is hardcoded. It must be a **flat**
directory of `.pdf` files (subdirectories are not searched); each filename stem becomes that
report's id in the manifest, so stems must be unique. Nothing is parsed from the filename —
teams, venue, stage and date all come from the PDF's own cover page. The machine-readable
manifest is written to `work/verification/verification-report.json` (override with `--output`),
and a human-readable summary, grouped by venue and by matchday round, is printed to the console.

Add `--expect-reports N` to assert the corpus size, so a mistyped path cannot pass as a run:

```
pipeline\venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pipeline.validate.verify --input-dir <corpus-dir> --expect-reports 104
```

Exit codes, so a CI job can tell a failed gate from a broken harness:

| code | meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `0` | clean gate — every sampled report checked, no deviations, no corpus gaps |
| `1` | gate failed — deviations and/or corpus gaps were recorded |
| `2` | the harness could not run (bad input directory, unwritable output) |

An **empty corpus is a failure, not a clean run**. The gate also reports `corpus_gaps` for any
matchday round with no report present, and any group holding fewer than its 6 fixtures leaves
those reports unassigned rather than guessing a matchday — a partial corpus cannot tell
"matchday 1" from "the first match of this team I happen to hold".

The gate is designed to be re-run cheaply by every later extraction story: each story registers
its own checks with the check registry in `pipeline/validate/checks.py` without modifying the
runner, the sample selection, or the report format.

## Layout

```
pipeline/
  discover/   text-anchored page discovery, anchor registry, corpus metadata probe
  validate/   check registry, sample selection, verification runner, CLI
  tests/      pytest suite
```

## Tests

From the repo root, using the venv interpreter explicitly:

```
pipeline\venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pytest pipeline/tests
```

Or activate the venv first, after which the bare `python` form works:

```
pipeline\venv\Scripts\activate
python -m pytest pipeline/tests
```

A bare `python -m pytest pipeline/tests` **without** activating the venv will fail with
`ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'pymupdf'` — the system interpreter has none of the
pinned stack installed.

Tests are deterministic and offline. Real-PDF tests use the permanent ground-truth fixture
`spike/mex_rsa.pdf`; set-cover, matchday-derivation, and report-format tests use synthetic
fixtures and need no PDFs.
